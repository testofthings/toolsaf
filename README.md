# Toolsaf

[Table of contents](documentation/README.md)

Welcome to the early version of **Toolsaf**, a tool-driven security assessment framework.
Toolsaf is intended for security assessment of _Internet of Things_ (IoT) and other systems with the help of common security tools.
The process of using Toolsaf for security assessment has two main phases:

  1. Creation of a _security statement_ which describes security-related features of an IoT product or system.
  2. Verification of the security statement with security tools.

Some of the applications of this approach could be:

  1. Security testing and regression testing of IoT systems.
  2. Communicating system security properites in a machine-readable and verifiable format.
  3. Documenting results of a system's reverse-engineering.

Toolsaf is an open-source project driven by [Test of Things](https://testofthings.com).
It was originally created as part of Rauli Kaksonen's doctoral thesis [Transparent and tool-driven security assessment for sustainable IoT cybersecurity](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:oulu-202406264941) under the name of 'tdsaf'.
The thesis introduces _Tool-driven security assessment_ (TDSA) to enhance the cybersecurity of
IoT products and systems.

## How Toolsaf and TDSA work?

The basic idea of TDSA is to first describe the IoT system or product with
the security statement, then use tools to verify that the security statement is accurate, and finally use
the statement for different purposes.
A security statement provides a machine-readable description of the system's security,
which allows automated verification.

At the moment, security statements are created by Toolsaf using a dedicated Python-based _Domain-Specific Language_ (DSL).
(JSON-based format is under development).
Security statement verification is done by running any of the [supported tools](documentation/Tools.md) and saving their output. Toolsaf uses the tools' output to verify that the security statement is accurate.
Some tools perform their own security checks, which can be incorporated into the security statement verdict.

## Getting Started with Toolsaf

The following shows how to start using Toolsaf.
For this, you need to perform two tasks:

  1.  Install the Toolsaf Python module.
  2.  Initialize a new or copy an existing security statement.

You need a recent [Python](https://www.python.org/) interpreter, such as 3.10 or newer.
Most Linux distributions should already come with a suitable one, the command
name might be `python3` to separate from older Python interpreters.

The installation of Toolsaf is currently done from the _GitHub_ repository, as there is no _PyPi_ package for Toolsaf, yet.
First, clone this repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/testofthings/toolsaf.git # HTTPS
# OR
git clone git@github.com:testofthings/toolsaf.git     # SSH
```
Now that Toolsaf is installed, you have to create a directory and a Python virtual environment for your first security statement.
The commands below produce the [expected project structure](documentation/CreatingSecurityStatements.md#project-structure) for your statement.

```shell
mkdir statement-device && cd statement-device
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment
mkdir device
touch device/statement.py
```

Toolsaf must be taken into use in the statement's directory with the following command.
(The option `--config-settings editable_mode=strict` is required by some tools to properly work with locally cloned module.)
```shell
pip install -e ../toolsaf/ --config-settings editable_mode=strict
```

Alternatively, you may copy an existing security statement.
In that case you must also create and activate the virtual environment and install the Toolsaf module.

If you want to visualize your security statements you also need to install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/).

In the above, we used _venv_ virtual environments, but as security statements are essentially
Python-code, any other environment should work fine.

## Working with Security Statements

To recap, a security statement is Python DSL code in its own directory, which uses the Toolsaf Python module.
This section explains how to create security statements and then verify them.
As an example, we have created a security statement for the _Deltaco Smart Outdoor Plug_.

There are two basic approaches to build a security statement:

  1. Write the security statement code first, then run tools and verify it.
  2. Run tools to collect information first, then write security statement to match that.

If youâ€™re the device manufacturer you will likely use the former approach, as you (hopefully)
know your product's attack surface and other properties.
If you are a security researcher who is reverse-engineering or pen-testing a product,
you have to use the latter approach.

We created the example security statement using the latter approach, as we learned the device properties on the go

The following documents describe security statements in detail:

  - [Creating Security Statements](documentation/CreatingSecurityStatements.md)
  - [Verifying Security Statements](documentation/VerifyingSecurityStatements.md)

## Command Line Options

Toolsaf is a command-line tool, and its command-line options are listed [here](documentation/CommandLineOptions.md).

## Sample Security Statements
A security statement for _Ruuvi gateway and tags_ (https://ruuvi.com/) was developed during the PhD research. The statement is in the directory `samples/ruuvi/`. The data for verifying the security statement is available for academic research, please request it from Rauli. Please specify the goals of the research and the organization performing it. Right to refuse requests is reserved.

The security statement for Ruuvi is executed like this, assuming working directory is the _toolsaf_ root directory:
```shell
python samples/ruuvi/ruuvi.py
```
The command outputs basic information about the security statement.
