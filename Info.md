# Toolsaf

Welcome to the early version of **Toolsaf**, a tool-driven security assessment framework.
Toolsaf is for security assessment of _Internet of Things_ (IoT) and other systems using different security tools.
Security assessment process using Toolsaf has two main phases:

  1. Creation of a _security statement_ which describes security-related features of an IoT product or system.
  2. Verification of the security statement with security tools, thus confirming the security posture of the product or system.

Some of the applications of this approach could be:

  1. Security testing and regression testing of IoT systems.
  2. Communicating system security properites in a machine-readable and verifiable format.
  3. Documenting results of a system's reverse-engineering.

Toolsaf is an open-source project driven by [Test of Things](https://testofthings.com). More information about toolsaf can be found in [Toolsaf Github](https://github.com/testofthings/toolsaf).
