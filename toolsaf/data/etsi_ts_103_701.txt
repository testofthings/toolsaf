5.1.3
5.1.3.0

Test group 5.1-3
Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.1-3.
According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] best practice cryptography is defined as cryptography that is
suitable for the corresponding use case and has no indication of a feasible attack with current readily available
techniques.
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the cryptographic methods provide the security guarantees
that are necessary for the authentication mechanisms and, secondly, whether the cryptographic methods are not known
to be vulnerable to a feasible attack.

5.1.3.1

Test case 5.1-3-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the cryptography used for the authentication mechanisms
concerning the use of best practice cryptography (a-c) and the vulnerability to a feasible attack d).
Test units

shall assess whether the "Security Guarantees" are appropriate for the use case of user authentication, at least
integrity and authenticity are required to be fulfilled.

b) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL
shall assess whether the mechanism according to "Description" is appropriate to achieve the "Security
Guarantees".

NOTE 1: A holistic approach is required to assess the security of the mechanism.

c) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL
shall assess whether the "Cryptographic Details" are considered as best practice cryptography for the use case
of user authentication based on a reference catalogue. If "Cryptographic Details" are not included in a
reference catalogue for the corresponding use case (e.g. novel cryptography), the SO shall provide evidences,
e.g. a risk analysis, to justify the cryptography is appropriate as best practice for the use case. In such case the
TL shall assess whether the evidence is appropriate and reliable for the use case.

NOTE 2: A use case based list of examples for best practice cryptography is given in ETSI TR 103 621 [i.7].
Moreover general reference catalogues of best practice cryptography are available, for example:


SOGIS Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms (https://www.sogis.eu).

NOTE 3: A cryptographic algorithm or primitive that is deprecated with regard to its desired security property
(e.g. SHA1 for collision resistance) or that relies on a cryptographic parameter (e.g. key-size) that is not
appropriate, taking into account the intended lifetime of the DUT and cryptoagility, cannot be considered
as best practice cryptography.

d) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL
shall assess whether the "Cryptographic Details" are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the
desired security property on the base of the "Security Guarantees" by reference to competent cryptanalytic
reports.

NOTE 4: Competent cryptanalytic reports are typically published in the scientific literature or, alternatively, are to
be provided by the SO. Further, clause D.2 provides information about the expected attack potential for
level basic.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if for all user authentication mechanisms:- the security guarantees are appropriate for the use case of user authentication; and
- the mechanism is appropriate to achieve the security guarantees with respect to the use case; and
- all used cryptographic details are considered as best practice for the use case; and

Test group 5.3-1

5.3.1.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.3-1.
This test group handles the updatability of each software components except software updates are beyond practicability
or absent for a security reason. According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] "securely updateable" means
that there are adequate measures to prevent an attacker misusing the update mechanism.
NOTE: Any discovery of software components in the DUT is out of scope of this test group.

5.3.1.1


Test case 5.3-1-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the updatability of software components concerning the
absence of software updates a) and the update mechanisms b).
Test units

a) For each software component in IXIT 6-SoftComp with an empty list in "Update Mechanism", the TL shall
assess whether the implementation of software updates is beyond practicability or for a security reason as
described in the justification for the absence of software updates.

EXAMPLE 1:

An IoT device can contain separate microcontrollers from the main system which are only
internally addressable. Those microcontrollers typically act as an internal service provider (e.g.
temperature controller of a smart wine rack) sometimes without update functionality. A software
update for those components can be beyond practicability for the DUT.

EXAMPLE 2:

For some implementations, the security concept for the DUT can require that a component is not
changeable (e.g. software which is part of the trust chain of the bootloader). Therefore the
component is not updateable for superordinate security reasons.

b) The TL shall apply all test units as specified in the Test case 5.3-2-1 to every referenced "Update Mechanism"
in IXIT 6-SoftComp.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- for all software components without the ability for software updates, a software update is not possible for
practicability reasons or security reasons; and
- no update mechanism can be misused by an attacker.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.3-2.
This test group examines that at least one update mechanism for the secure installation of software updates exists.

5.3.2.1

Test case 5.3-2-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose

measures to prevent an attacker misusing the update installation on the DUT.
Test units

a) For each update mechanism in IXIT 7-UpdMech, the TL shall assess whether the design of the update
mechanism prevents misuse from an attacker according to the "Security Guarantees", the corresponding
"Description", "Cryptographic Details" and "Initiation and Interaction".

NOTE:

The consideration of the baseline attacker model described in clause D.2 is helpful for the examination.

EXAMPLE:

A misuse can be the installation of an old software update to downgrade the security capabilities of
the DUT or the injection of malware by manipulating a valid update.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- one update mechanism of the DUT cannot be misused by an attacker.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.3.2.2

Test case 5.3-2-2 (functional)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the effectiveness of the update mechanism to avoid misuse.
Test units

a) For each update mechanism in IXIT 7-UpdMech, the TL shall devise functional attacks to misuse the update
mechanism based on the "Description".

EXAMPLE 1:

If applicable try a Man-In-The-Middle attack (MITM) between the DUT and the update server.

NOTE 1: An attack can be trying to resume the sequence of update steps after some failure of a specific update
step, installing an older firmware version that contains security vulnerabilities, or changing one byte in a
signed firmware to check that it is rejected.
NOTE 2: There are multiple ways to perform an indication based security analysis even if no update is available
during the assessment, e.g. verify a file based update mechanism on the base of old update packages.

b) The TL shall attempt to misuse each update mechanism on the base of the devised adverse actions and assess
whether the design of the mechanism (see "Description", the "Cryptographic Details" and "Initiation and
Interaction") effectively prevents the misuse of software updates as described in the "Security Guarantees".

EXAMPLE 2:

If a file based update mechanism uses signature verifications, providing a manipulated update
package to the DUT can be helpful to collect indications.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- there is no indication that a misuse of one update mechanism of the DUT is possible.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

Test group 5.3-7

5.3.7.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.3-7.
According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] best practice cryptography is defined as cryptography that is
suitable for the corresponding use case and has no indication of a feasible attack with current readily available
techniques.
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the cryptographic methods provide the security guarantees
that are necessary for the secure update mechanisms and, secondly, whether the cryptographic methods are not known
to be vulnerable to a feasible attack.

5.3.7.1

Test case 5.3-7-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the cryptography used for the update mechanisms
concerning the use of best practice cryptography (a-c) and the vulnerability to a feasible attack d).
Test units

a) For each update mechanism in IXIT 7-UpdMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Security Guarantees" are

c) For each update mechanism in IXIT 7-UpdMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Cryptographic Details" are
considered as best practice cryptography for the use case of secure updates based on a reference catalogue. If
"Cryptographic Details" are not included in a reference catalogue for the corresponding use case (e.g. novel
cryptography), the SO shall provide evidences, e.g. a risk analysis, to justify the cryptography is appropriate as
best practice for the use case. In such case the TL shall assess whether the evidence is appropriate and reliable
for the use case.

NOTE 2: A use case based list of examples for best practice cryptography is given in ETSI TR 103 621 [i.7].
Moreover general reference catalogues of best practice cryptography are available, for example:
- SOGIS Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms (https://www.sogis.eu).

NOTE 3: A cryptographic algorithm or primitive that is deprecated with regard to its desired security property (e.g.
SHA1 for collision resistance) or that relies on a cryptographic parameter (e.g. key-size) that is not
appropriate, taking into account the intended lifetime of the DUT and cryptoagility, cannot be considered
as best practice cryptography.

d) For each update mechanism in IXIT 7-UpdMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Cryptographic Details" are
not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the desired security property on the base of the "Security
Guarantees" by reference to competent cryptanalytic reports.

NOTE 4: Competent cryptanalytic reports are typically published in the scientific literature or, alternatively, are to
be provided by the SO. Further, clause D.2 provides information about the expected attack potential for
level basic.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if for all update mechanisms:- the security guarantees are appropriate for the use case of secure updates; and
- the mechanism is appropriate to achieve the security guarantees with respect to the use case; and

TSO 5.4: Securely store sensitive security parameters

5.4.1

Test group 5.4-1

5.4.1.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.4-1.
This test group assesses whether sensitive security parameters are securely stored according to their type using the
claimed protection schemes. However the assessment does not give assurance for the completeness of the documented
sensitive security parameters apart from consistency with respect to other IXIT.
NOTE:

Threat modelling e.g. provided by the SO and the baseline attacker model described in clause D.2 is
helpful to derive appropriate security guarantees, conceptually evaluate the corresponding protection
schemes and functionally evaluate the correct implementation on a basic level.

5.4.1.1

Test case 5.4-1-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the secure storage of sensitive security parameters
concerning the security claims (a-c) and the completeness of the IXIT documentation d).
Test units

a) The TL shall assess whether the declaration in "Type" of each sensitive security parameter provided in
IXIT 10-SecParam is consistent with the "Description".

b) The TL shall assess whether the "Security Guarantees" of each sensitive security parameter provided in
IXIT 10-SecParam matches at least the protection needs indicated by "Type".

NOTE 1: Critical security parameter require integrity and confidentiality protection while public security parameter
require integrity protection only.

c) The TL shall assess whether the "Protection Scheme" of each sensitive security parameter provided in
IXIT 10-SecParam provides the claimed "Security Guarantees".

NOTE 2: Consider the usage of external evidences (see clause 4.7) to (partially) cover the provision if a secure element
is used.

d) The TL shall assess the completeness of the sensitive security parameters in IXIT 10-SecParam by considering
indications for sensitive security parameters in the provided information in all other IXITs.

EXAMPLE:

If there are authentication mechanisms described in IXIT 1-AuthMech, the verification whether
the corresponding cryptographic parameters are listed in IXIT 10-SecParam can be helpful to
collect indications.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- for every sensitive security parameter the declaration is consistent with its description; and
- for every sensitive security parameter the claimed security guarantees match their minimal protection needs;
and
- every sensitive security parameter has a suitable protection mechanism for the claimed security guarantees;
and

there is no indication, that the listed sensitive security parameters are incomplete.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.4.1.2

Test case 5.4-1-2 (functional)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the secure storage of sensitive security parameters.
Test units

a) The TL shall functionally assess whether for all sensitive security parameters provided in IXIT 10-SecParam
"Protection Scheme" is implemented according to the IXIT documentation.

NOTE:

Typically, while examine the DUT for indicating evidences for the existence and enforcement of the
documented protection scheme for a sensitive security parameter, an indication for non-conformity of the
implementation can be found, if existing on a basic level.

EXAMPLE:

If the "Protection Scheme" states that a sensitive security parameter is only accessible for a
privileged user and is protected by the OS access control, attempting to gain access to the
parameter over unprivileged processes (e.g. path manipulation via remote interfaces) can be
helpful to collect indications.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- for every sensitive security parameter there is no indication that the implementation of the corresponding
protection scheme differs from its IXIT documentation.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.4.2

Test group 5.4-2

5.4.2.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.4-2.
In this case hard-coded unique per device identity is an individual and static value, that represents the DUT and
potential hard-coded information the value is derived from.
The test group addresses the identification of hard-coded device identities and whether adequate protection needs are
identified. A functional evaluation for tamper proof storage by any means is not in focus of this TSO.
NOTE 1: The conceptual evaluation of protection schemes for tamper-resistance of hard-coded identities and an
inspection for indication for the correct implementation of the corresponding schemes is part of Test
group 5.4-1 by construction. However, the corresponding test units are referenced here and are
optimizable when deriving a test plan.
NOTE 2: A communicated device identity can be derived from a - potentially secret - piece of information that
persists in hardware (e.g. a seed value for a randomization algorithm). This information can be considered
as part of a device identity.

5.4.2.1

Test case 5.4-2-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of tamper-resistant storage of hard-coded identities.
Test units

a) The TL shall check whether for each sensitive security parameter in IXIT 10-SecParam where the
"Description" indicates that it is used as an hard-coded identity, a corresponding explicit statement is provided.

b) The TL shall assess whether for each hard-coded identity as indicated in "Description" in IXIT 10-SecParam
the corresponding "Security Guarantees" provide tamper-resistance.

NOTE 1: Tamper-resistance addresses protection against means such as physical, electrical and software means.
NOTE 2: Consider the usage of external evidences (see clause 4.7) to (partially) cover the provision if a secure
element is used.

c) The TL shall assess whether the "Protection Scheme" of each hard-coded identity as indicated in "Description"
in IXIT 10-SecParam provides the claimed "Security Guarantees" with respect to tamper-resistance.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:
- there is no indication that any hard-coded identity is not documented as such; and
- for all hard-coded identities the security guarantee includes tamper-resistance; and
- every hard-coded identity has a suitable protection mechanism for tamper-resistance.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.4.2.2

Test case 5.4-2-2 (functional)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of tamper-resistant storage of hard-coded identities.
Test units

a) The TL shall functionally assess whether each hard-coded identity as indicated in "Description" in
IXIT 10-SecParam the "Protection Scheme" with respect to tamper-resistance is implemented according to the
IXIT documentation.

NOTE:

Typically, while examine the DUT for indicating evidences for the existence and enforcement of the
documented protection scheme for a sensitive security parameter, indication for non-conformity of the
implementation can be found, if existing on a basic level.

EXAMPLE:

If the "Protection Scheme" states that a hard-coded identity is protected against tampering by a
secure element, verifying the existence and the correct integration of a secure element can be
helpful to collect an indication.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- for every hard-coded identity, there is no indication that the implementation of any protection scheme with
respect to tamper-resistance differs from its IXIT documentation.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.4.3
5.4.3.0

Test group 5.4-3
Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.4-3.
In this case a hard-coded parameter in device software source code is a static value, that is common in every device
where the same code as for the DUT is implemented.

This test group assesses whether there is an indication for not documented hard-coded critical security parameters in
device software source code in the provided provisioning mechanisms for critical security parameters. Wherever critical
security parameters are hard-coded in device software source code the assessment focuses on conformity of design and
functional evaluation of the provisioning mechanism that makes sure that these are not used during the operation of the
DUT. This approach cannot provide strong assurance for completeness of the IXIT documentation concerning the
identification of hard-coded critical security parameters in device software source code.
It is noted that this approach does not preclude supplementary approaches, e.g. active approaches based on scanning the
software of the DUT for embedded patterns that match critical security parameters. Supplementary approaches are at
the discretion of the TL.
NOTE:

Public security parameters can be embedded in the object code of the software of the DUT.

5.4.3.1

Test case 5.4-3-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of hard-coded critical security parameters.
Test units

a) The TL shall check whether for all critical security parameters provided in IXIT 10-SecParam where

in "Description".

b) The TL shall assess whether for all critical security parameters in IXIT 10-SecParam, which are hard coded in
device software source code according to "Description", the corresponding "Provisioning Mechanism" ensures
that it is not used during the operation of the DUT.

NOTE:

According to the definition of critical security parameter in ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2]
the disclosure or modification of such a parameter can compromise the security of the DUT. Parameters
where disclosure or modification compromises solely other assets (e.g. intellectual properties) are not
covered by the definition.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- there is no indication that any critical security parameter hard-coded in device software source code is not
documented as such; and
- for all critical security parameter hard-coded in device software source code, the "Provisioning Mechanism"
ensures that it is not used during the operation of the DUT.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.4.3.2

Test case 5.4-3-2 (functional)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of hard-coded critical security parameters.
Test units

a) The TL shall functionally assess whether for all critical security parameters hard-coded in device software
source code documented in "Description" of IXIT 10-SecParam, the "Provisioning Mechanism" is indeed
applied during the operation of the DUT.

EXAMPLE:

If a provisioning mechanism states that a hard-coded critical security parameter is intended to be
replaced by the user using individual data (e.g. based on a QR code), the verification that the user
is requested to input this data can be helpful to collect an indication.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- for all critical security parameter hard-coded in device software source code there is no indication that the
application of the provisioning mechanism differs from its IXIT documentation.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.4.4

Test group 5.4-4

5.4.4.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.4-4.
This test group assesses by documentation whether all critical security parameter addressed by the underlying provision
are identified and that their generation mechanisms meet the corresponding requirement.

5.4.4.1

Test case 5.4-4-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of critical security parameters used for integrity and
authenticity checks of software updates and for protection of communication with associated services concerning the
generation mechanisms.
Test units

a) The TL shall check whether all critical security parameter provided in IXIT 10-SecParam, where
"Description" indicates that the critical security parameters are used for integrity and authenticity checks of
software updates or for protection of communication with associated services are documented as such in
"Generation Mechanism".

b) The TL shall assess for all critical security parameters provided in IXIT 10-SecParam, whether the
"Generation Mechanism" ensures that the critical security parameter is unique per device and produced with a
mechanism that reduces the risk of automated attacks against classes of devices.

NOTE 1: A random number generator used for the generation of the critical security parameter that has been
certified (e.g. against a scheme applicable under the European Cybersecurity Act) can be seen as a source
of sufficient entropy.
NOTE 2: It is also possible that custom solutions (that are e.g. not certified) provide sufficient entropy for the use
case of the DUT.
NOTE 3: The degree to which a generation mechanism is widely accepted as appropriate for a given use case is a
function of the consensus among the subject matter community. Generation mechanisms that are
standardized rank highest in such consensus, due to the high degree of scrutiny to which they are
subjected in their development. Standardization bodies offer publicly available sources of information on
suitable generation mechanisms, e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) runs the
Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program [i.2] for random bit generators, key derivation, secure
hashing, etc. In regard to end-to-end security and communities to which SME IoT manufacturers are
possibly keener with, Mozilla® publicly lists configuration profiles for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
[i.3]. Finally, there are publicly available catalogues of references to relevant standards, e.g. the
KeyLength catalogue [i.4] that indexes standards published by NIST, ANSSI, BSI, etc. on the matter of
cryptographic key length.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- all critical security parameter where the purpose in "Description" indicates that the critical security parameters
are used for integrity and authenticity checks of software updates or for protection of communication with
associated services are documented as such in "Generation Mechanism"; and

for all critical security parameters the "Generation Mechanism" ensures that the critical security parameters are
unique per device and produced with a mechanism that reduces the risk of automated attacks against classes of
devices.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.5.1.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.5-1.
According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] best practice cryptography is defined as cryptography that is
suitable for the corresponding use case and has no indication of a feasible attack with current readily available
techniques.
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the cryptographic methods provide the security guarantees
that are necessary for the use case of the communication and, secondly, whether the cryptographic methods are not
known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack.

5.5.1.1

Test case 5.5-1-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the cryptography used for the communication mechanisms
concerning the use of best practice cryptography (a-c) and the vulnerability to a feasible attack d).
Test units

a) For each communication mechanism in IXIT 11-ComMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Security
Guarantees" are appropriate for the use case of the communication.

b) For each communication mechanism in IXIT 11-ComMech, the TL shall assess whether the mechanism
according to "Description" is appropriate to achieve the "Security Guarantees".

NOTE 1: A holistic approach is required to assess the security of the communication mechanism.

c) For each communication mechanism in IXIT 11-ComMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Cryptographic
Details" are considered as best practice cryptography for the use case of secure communication based on a
reference catalogue. If "Cryptographic Details" are not included in a reference catalogue for the corresponding
use case (e.g. novel cryptography), the SO shall provide evidences, e.g. a risk analysis, to justify the
cryptography is appropriate as best practice for the use case. In such case the TL shall assess whether the
evidence is appropriate and reliable for the use case.

NOTE 2: A use case based list of examples for best practice cryptography is given in ETSI TR 103 621 [i.7].
Moreover general reference catalogues of best practice cryptography are available, for example:
- SOGIS Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms (https://www.sogis.eu).

NOTE 3: A cryptographic algorithm or primitive that is deprecated with regard to its desired security property
(e.g. SHA1 for collision resistance) or that relies on a cryptographic parameter (e.g. key-size) that is not
appropriate, taking into account the intended lifetime of the DUT and cryptoagility, cannot be considered
as best practice cryptography.

d) For each communication mechanism in IXIT 11-ComMech, the TL shall assess whether the "Cryptographic
Details" are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the desired security property on the base of the
"Security Guarantees" by reference to competent cryptanalytic reports.


NOTE 4: Competent cryptanalytic reports are typically published in the scientific literature or, alternatively, are to
be provided by the SO. Further, clause D.2 provides information about the expected attack potential for
level basic.
Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if for all communication mechanisms:- the security guarantees are appropriate for the use case of secure communication; and
- the mechanism is appropriate to achieve the security guarantees with respect to the use case; and

The terms "reviewed" and "evaluated" allow for a range of way to fulfil this provision. The term "reviewed" hints at
actions undertaken for finding and correcting defects, e.g. an independent security audit or a continuous process
allowing review and disclosure of vulnerabilities (a bug tracking system or automated code analysis). The term
"evaluated" hints at a formal comparison against a set of objectives, e.g. a recognized certification scheme.
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the network and security functionalities are reviewed or

5.5.3
5.5.3.0

Test group 5.5-3
Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.5-3.
The ability to update cryptographic algorithms and primitive does not only rely on the existence of an update
mechanism. It requires that the implementation can be replaced on the device, and that software that rely on
cryptographic algorithms and primitives can support such replacement.
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether there is an update mechanism for each software component
indicating such implementation and, secondly, whether the implementations providing cryptographic algorithms and
primitives can be replaced and side effects of updating are considered by the manufacturer.

5.5.4.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.5-4.
There exist many authentication methods based on a variety of authentication factors and applying to different subjects
(such as persons, devices, or functions). Three important characteristics to look for is whether the authentication method
can discriminate between multiple subjects, whether it can reject authentication attempts based on invalid credentials or
no proper access rights (effectiveness), and whether it is resistant to an adversary by providing its own security
guarantees or rely on the security guarantees provided by an underlying protocol (e.g. TLS).
The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the device functionalities are accessible only after
authentication, secondly, whether the authentication method can discriminate between different subjects, thirdly,
whether it is effective and resistant to adversaries and, finally, whether the authorization step is effective.

authentication mechanism described in IXIT 1-AuthMech allows to discriminate between multiple
authentication subjects and can reject authentication attempts based on invalid identities and/or authentication
factors.

NOTE:

Discriminating is typically done based on unique identities and/or authentication factors.

c) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall assess whether the means
protecting the authentication mechanism in "Cryptographic Details" in IXIT 1-AuthMech provide the
"Security Guarantees" identified for the mechanism and are resistant to attempts at compromising the
mechanism.

d) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall assess whether the
authorization process described in "Description" in IXIT 1-AuthMech allows authenticated subjects with
proper access rights to be granted access and denies authenticated subjects with inadequate access rights or
unauthenticated subjects to be granted access.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- at least one authentication mechanism is referenced for every device functionality accessible via network
interface in the initialized state; and
- every authentication mechanism allows to discriminate between multiple authentication subjects and to reject
authentication attempts based on invalid identities and/or authentication factors; and
- the means used to protect an authentication mechanism provide the expected security guarantees and are
resistant at attempts to compromise the mechanism; and
- every authorization mechanism allows access to authenticated subjects with proper access rights; and

initialized state concerning authentication and authorization.
Test units

a) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall functionally assess
whether an unauthenticated subject and a subject with invalid identity or credentials and an authenticated

whether an authenticated subject with appropriate access rights can access the device functionality in the
initialized state.

c) For each "Authentication Mechanism" referenced in IXIT 13-SoftServ, the TL shall functionally assess
whether the protection of the authentication mechanism conforms to the description in "Security Guarantees"
and "Cryptographic Details" in IXIT 1-AuthMech.

EXAMPLE:

If a PKI certificate based authentication is used, sniffing the used certificates and comparing the
properties with the described cryptography in the IXIT can be helpful to collect an indication.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if for every device functionality accessible via network interface in the initialized state:- an unauthenticated subject, a subject with invalid identity or invalid credentials and an authenticated subject
without appropriate access rights cannot access the functionality in the initialized state; and

TSO 5.6: Minimize exposed attack surfaces

5.6.1

Test group 5.6-1

5.6.1.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-1.
In principle a logical interface can be accessible via a plurality of network interface: the manufacturer therefore ensures
that all access paths to a logical interface are identified. The manufacturer disables those network and logical interfaces
that are not required to provide the device functionality, depending on the interface purpose. This requires having
knowledge of their platform and understand which components provide network or logical interfaces, and how. This is
critical when hardware platforms and components from third-parties are reused.

5.6.1.1

Test case 5.6-1-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the network and logical interfaces of the DUT.
Test units

TL shall assess whether the purpose of the interface in "Description" provides a valid justification for being
enabled.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- for every network or logical interface that is marked as enabled in the IXIT documentation, there is a purpose
that provides a valid justification for the interface to be enabled.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.6.1.2

Test case 5.6-1-2 (functional)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the network and logical interfaces of the DUT a) and the
completeness of the IXIT documentation b).
Test units

a) For each network and logical interface in IXIT 15-Intf, the TL shall functionally check whether the status of
the interface matches the "Status" in the IXIT documentation.

NOTE:

A possible method to analyse an interface is to use protocol testing tools in a black-box setting and to
infer from the obtained information whether the interface is enabled or disabled on the DUT. For cases
where the DUT provides an indication (e.g. a visual indication of connectors, antennas and components)
whether the interface is enabled or disabled, the accessibility test allows to confirm or disprove the
indication.

b) The TL shall functionally assess whether network or logical interfaces that are not documented in IXIT 15-Intf
are available via a network interface on the DUT.

EXAMPLE:

Network scanning tools allow for discovery of network or logical interfaces.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if:- every documented network or logical interface that is marked as disabled in the IXIT documentation is found
to be disabled or not accessible on the DUT; and
- every discovered network and logical interface is documented in the IXIT.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.6.2

Test group 5.6-2

5.6.2.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-2.
The principle of minimization applied to security-relevant information in unauthenticated context dictates that only such
information that is necessary for device or service operations in unauthenticated context are disclosed. It is to be noted
that the manufacturer might not be able to minimize disclosed information if requirements exist to conform to
standardized protocols which, by design, disclose more information than necessary.
EXAMPLE:

5.6.2.1

by the interface without authentication in the initialized state and indicated as not security-relevant, is however
security-relevant.

b) For each network interface in IXIT 15-Intf, the TL shall assess whether the "Disclosed Information" disclosed
by the interface without authentication in the initialized state and indicated as security-relevant, is necessary
for the operation of the DUT.

Assignment of verdict
The verdict PASS is assigned if for every network interface:- every security-relevant information disclosed by the interface without authentication in the initialized state is
documented as such; and
- all security-relevant information disclosed by the interface without authentication in the initialized state is
necessary for the operation of the DUT.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.6.2.2

Test case 5.6-2-2 (functional)

Test purpose

5.6.3

Test group 5.6-3

5.6.3.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-3.
Some physical interfaces require exposure in order to allow normal operations. The remaining interfaces are to be
protected in exposure. In order to identify the appropriate level of protection, the introduction of ETSI
TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] is considered, which indicates a protection "against elementary attacks on
fundamental design weaknesses". Taking this in consideration, protection from exposure for physical interfaces is
relative to the device casing, i.e. the protection is sufficient when accessing the physical interface requires opening or
breaking the device casing (this does not preclude stronger measures when necessary) or similar measures.
It is to be noted that protection through the casing is not effective for air interfaces. Such air interfaces that do not
require exposure are to be disabled. Interfaces that are not permanently necessary require a form of trusted enabling
mechanism (with a default of disabled).
The objective of this test group is to assess on the one hand, whether physical port interfaces that never require exposure
are protected by the device casing. On the other hand it is assessed, whether air interfaces that never require exposure
are disabled.

5.6.4
5.6.4.0

Test group 5.6-4
Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-4.

Similar considerations to those of Test group 5.6-3 apply, with the exception that a software mechanism to disable the
debug interface is mandatory. Here, the debug interface might be permanently disabled in software or, if it is foreseen
that it can be useful in specific cases of the device lifecycle, be under the control of a trusted software mechanism.
Considering the level of security intended by ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2], physically accessible is
defined as being readily usable with a standard interface cable. Using specific tooling to physically access the interface
(such as testing probes) is not in scope of the assessment.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.6.5

Test group 5.6-5

5.6.5.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-5.
There exist primarily three approaches to fulfil this provision, firstly, a service management framework is configured to
only launch and manage those software services that are required for the operation of the consumer IoT device.
Secondly, access to these software services is prevented through a filtering mechanism such as a packet filter (firewall),
even if such service is active. Finally, software services that are not required for the operation of the device are not
installed - this is the hardest approach and it goes beyond the requirements of the provision.
It is to be noted that it is difficult to achieve full minimization, for example there can be services that are enabled by
default by an IoT platform provider.

5.6.5.1

Test case 5.6-5-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the enabled services concerning the intended use or
operation of the DUT.
Test units

a) For each software service in IXIT 13-SoftServ that is enabled by default according to "Status", the TL shall
assess whether the service is necessary for the intended use or operation of the DUT according to the purpose
in "Description" and the "Justification" for enabling the service.

Assignment of verdict

DUT.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.6.6
5.6.6.0

Test group 5.6-6
Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-6.
There exist many options to minimize code. Within large software projects, automated tools can be used to identify and
remove dead code. Dependency and package managers allow to install only the components needed for the operations
of service software, some have the ability to prune unused software out of the codebase once an option is disabled or a
package removed. Third-party software providers possibly give options to what is included in the packaging,
compilation or installation of their software.
Code minimization is assessed in terms of whether the selected method actually helps in minimizing code, to which
extend, and whether the code minimization effort is proportionate to the reduction of the security risk. In assessing this
latter dimension the introduction of ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] can be referred to.

5.6.6.1

5.6.7

Test group 5.6-7

5.6.7.0

Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-7.
Many operating systems for the IoT allow to reduce the privileges necessary for a given piece of software to run. This
approach relies on three principles: separation of duty, need to know, and minimization of privileges. The ability to
minimize privileges depends both on the application of the first two principles and on the functionalities provided by
the hardware and software platform (for example mechanisms such as No eXecute (NX) bit, system calls, accounts,
capabilities, pledge). The principle of need to know goes together with minimization of privilege.

Test case 5.6-7-1 (conceptual)

Test purpose
The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the privilege control mechanisms of the DUT.
Test units

a) The TL shall assess whether all mechanisms to control privileges of software on the DUT in IXIT 17-PrivlCtrl
together facilitate the principles of separation of duty, need to know and minimization of privilege.

Assignment of verdict

to know and minimization of privilege.

The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.

5.6.8.0

Test group 5.6-8
Test group objective

The test group addresses the provision 5.6-8.
Many options exist that can be combined to provide hardware-level access control mechanisms for memory. At the
level of grey-box testing this can be evaluation based on documentation provided by the manufacturer (e.g. schematics,
bill of material, documentation resulting from certification of hardware components) or upon visual inspection of the
board (visual identification of components) and documentation provided by hardware components suppliers.

The objective of this test group is to assess whether the identified hardware-level mechanisms do provide for access
